The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were originally developed as an indie comic series by writer/artist Kevin Eastman and artist Peter Laird in 1984, and quickly became a phenomenon with many more books and toys and television shows and movies.  The TMNT started out in Eastman‚Äôs drawings as ‚Äúrobot ninja turtles‚Äù, but their name was changed to ‚Äúteenage mutant ninja turtles‚Äù by his friend Roger Rose at Marvel comics.  One of the main characters is named Michelangelo, and a few of the other characters have titles drawn from Italian Renaissance art - Raphael, Donatello, Leonardo, and Donatello, respectively.  For those who are curious, the four turtles originally were named after the band Devo, and Eastman simply changed them as part of a deal for licensing the comic.  Incidentally, I think the reason Eastman chose the Renaissance was because of his interest in Renaissance music, and Michelangelo‚Äôs artistic efforts were well-known and inspirational for him.

From the passage note down the various celebrities who joined TikTok . List the results in comma separated format.
ByteDance planned on Douyin expanding overseas. The founder of ByteDance, Zhang Yiming, stated that ""China is home to only one-fifth of Internet users globally. If we don't expand on a global scale, we are bound to lose to peers eyeing the four-fifths. So, going global is a must.""[20]

The app was launched as TikTok in the international market in September 2017.[21] On 23 January 2018, the TikTok app ranked first among free application downloads on app stores in Thailand and other countries.[22]

TikTok has been downloaded more than 130 million times in the United States and has reached 2 billion downloads worldwide,[23][24] according to data from mobile research firm Sensor Tower (those numbers exclude Android users in China).[25]

In the United States, celebrities, including Jimmy Fallon and Tony Hawk, began using the app in 2018.[26][27] Other celebrities, including Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Alba, Will Smith, and Justin Bieber joined TikTok as well as many others.[28]

In January 2019, TikTok allowed creators to embed merchandise sale links into their videos.[29]

i'm sharing an article and a question here. article:
IntroductionEmotions are a central component of our existence as human beings, and are manifested by physiological and psychological changes that often affect behavior and action. Emotions involve a complicated interplay of mind, body, language, and culture BIBREF0.
Detecting and recognizing emotions is a difficult task for machines. Nevertheless, following the successful use of computational linguistics to analyze sentiment in texts, there is growing interest in the more difficult task of the automatic detection and classification of emotions in texts.
The detection of emotions in text is a complicated challenge for multiple reasons: first, emotions are complex entities, and no universally-agreed upon psychological model of emotions exists. Second, isolated texts convey less information compared to a complete human interaction in which emotions can be detected from the other person's facial expressions, listening to their tone of voice, etc. However, due to important applications in fields such as psychology, marketing, and political science, research in this topic is now expanding rapidly BIBREF1.
In particular, dialogue systems such as those available on social media or instant messaging services are rich sources of textual data and have become the focus of much attention. Emotions of utterances within dialogues can be detected more precisely due to the presence of more context. For example, a single utterance (‚ÄúOK!‚Äù) might convey different emotions (happiness, anger, surprise), depending on its context. Taking all this into consideration, in 2018 the EmotionX Challenge asked participants to detect emotions in complete dialogues BIBREF2. Participants were challenged to classify utterances using Ekman's well-known theory of six basic emotions (sadness, happiness, anger","38    Below is an instruction that describes a task....

Q: It takes Matt 2 minutes per problem to do his math homework with a calculator and 5 minutes per problem without a calculator. If Matt's assignment has 20 problems, how much time will using a calculator save?
A: First find the time difference per problem: 5 minutes / problem - 2 minutes / problem = 3 minutes / problem. Then multiply that number by the number of problems to find the total time difference: 3 minutes / problem * 20 problems = 60 minutes. The answer is 60.
Question: Bobby wanted pancakes for breakfast. The recipe on the box makes 21 pancakes. While he ate 5 pancakes, his dog jumped up and was able to eat 7 before being caught. How many pancakes does Bobby have left?
Answer: Bobby ate 5 pancakes and his dog ate 7 so 5 + 7 = 12. The recipe makes 21 pancakes and 12 were eaten so 21 - 12 = 9 pancakes were left. The answer is 9.

A robotic voice (Henry Ramer) reads the captions:Planet Earth has colonized other planets for its own purposes. We are in 2078, and Sirius 6B is one of our colonies. What we want from this planet is a new energetic material, berynium. The problem is that this material is highly polluting and radioactive. Because of the careless mining, the one Sirius 6B planet is now a ravaged desertic land, not fertile as it used to be. NEB Corporation, a monopoly, have controlled all mining operations in this planet and all the Solar System. The Alliance, a mixture of a union and a series of scientists, tried to stop NBE from destroying the planet. NBE and The Alliance started a war in Sirius 6B, which also created a new Cold War in Earth. However, physical or nuclear war have only happened at Sirius 6B. Thousands of civilians died in this planet, and also they have the problem of radioactive clouds caused by the berynium. After 10 all-out war years, only a handful of survivors remain in the planet.The mining town looks like a dusty ghost town. Miners are playing for cigarettes. Through CCTV, they see somebody stumbling closer. That person, a NEB soldier (Sylvain Mass√©), looks terrified.

article: IntroductionOpen information extraction (IE, sekine2006demand, Banko:2007:OIE) aims to extract open-domain assertions represented in the form of $n$ -tuples (e.g., was born in; Barack Obama; Hawaii) from natural language sentences (e.g., Barack Obama was born in Hawaii). Open IE started from rule-based BIBREF0 and syntax-driven systems BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , and recently has used neural networks for supervised learning BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 .
A key step in open IE is confidence modeling, which ranks a list of candidate extractions based on their estimated quality. This is important for downstream tasks, which rely on trade-offs between the precision and recall of extracted assertions. For instance, an open IE-powered medical question answering (QA) system may require its assertions in higher precision (and consequently lower recall) than QA systems for other domains. For supervised open IE systems, the confidence score of an assertion is typically computed based on its extraction likelihood given by the model BIBREF3 , BIBREF5 . However, we observe that this often yields sub-optimal ranking results, with incorrect extractions of one sentence having higher likelihood than correct extractions of another sentence. We hypothesize this is due to the issue of a disconnect between training and test-time objectives. Specifically, the system is trained solely to raise likelihood of gold-standard extractions, and during training the model is not aware of its test-time behavior of ranking a set of system-","64    Below is an instruction that describes a task....

She arrives just before Mary Contrary (Jill Schoelen) is to be wedded to the unpleasant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan), although Mary loves Barnaby's nephew, Jack Nimble (Keanu Reeves). Lisa stops the wedding and, with her new friends, finds out that Barnaby plans to take over Toyland. Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie (Googy Gress) go to the kindly Toymaster (Pat Morita) for help, but he can only help them if Lisa really believes in toys. Barnaby confronts them and the Toymaster, finally showing his true colors, and steals a flask containing distilled evil that the Toymaster had been collecting, before leaving Lisa and company to be eaten by Trollog, a vulture-like monster with a single enchanted eye that Barnaby uses to spy on his enemies.

IntroductionTraditional machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks share the single-turn setting of answering a single question related to a passage. There is usually no connection between different questions and answers to the same passage. However, the most natural way humans seek answers is via conversation, which carries over context through the dialogue flow.
To incorporate conversation into reading comprehension, recently there are several public datasets that evaluate QA model's efficacy in conversational setting, such as CoQA BIBREF0 , QuAC BIBREF1 and QBLink BIBREF2 . In these datasets, to generate correct responses, models are required to fully understand the given passage as well as the context of previous questions and answers. Thus, traditional neural MRC models are not suitable to be directly applied to this scenario. Existing approaches to conversational QA tasks include BiDAF++ BIBREF3 , FlowQA BIBREF4 , DrQA+PGNet BIBREF0 , which all try to find the optimal answer span given the passage and dialogue history.
In this paper, we propose SDNet, a contextual attention-based deep neural network for the task of conversational question answering. Our network stems from machine reading comprehension models, but has several unique characteristics to tackle contextual understanding during conversation. Firstly, we apply both inter-attention and self-attention on passage and question to obtain a more effective understanding of the passage and dialogue history. Secondly, SDNet leverages the latest breakthrough in NLP: BERT contextual embedding BIBREF5 . Different from the canonical way of appending a thin layer after BERT structure according to BIBREF5 , we innovatively employed a weighted sum of BERT layer outputs, with locked BERT parameters. Thirdly, we prepend previous rounds of questions and answers","30    Below is an instruction that describes a task....

The exact cause of Sensory processing disorder is not known. However, it is known that the midbrain and brainstem regions of the central nervous system are early centers in the processing pathway for multisensory integration; these brain regions are involved in processes including coordination, attention, arousal, and autonomic function. After sensory information passes through these centers, it is then routed to brain regions responsible for emotions, memory, and higher level cognitive functions. Damage in any part of the brain involved in multisensory processing can cause difficulties in adequately processing stimuli in a functional way.

Financial instruments are monetary contracts between parties. They can be created, traded, modified and settled. They can be cash (currency), evidence of an ownership interest in an entity or a contractual right to receive or deliver in the form of currency (forex); debt (bonds, loans); equity (shares); or derivatives (options, futures, forwards).

International Accounting Standards IAS 32 and 39 define a financial instrument as ""any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity"".

Financial instruments may be categorized by ""asset class"" depending on whether they are equity-based (reflecting ownership of the issuing entity) or debt-based (reflecting a loan the investor has made to the issuing entity). If the instrument is debt it can be further categorized into short-term (less than one year) or long-term. Foreign exchange instruments and transactions are neither debt- nor equity-based and belong in their own category.

[Question]Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb, and Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla. If Kayla picked 20 apples, how many more apples did Suraya pick than Kayla?
[Answer]Caleb picked 20 - 5 = 15 apples. Suraya picked 12 + 15 = 27 apples. Suraya picked 27 - 20 = 7 apples more than Kayla. The answer is 7.

[Question]There are 24 students in the class. One-third had their school portraits taken before lunch. After lunch, but before gym class, 10 additional students had their portraits taken. After gym class, how many students have not yet had their picture taken?
[Answer]Before lunch, 24 / 3 = 8 students were photographed. Then 8 + 10 = 18 have been photographed by gym class. So 24 - 18 = 6 remain. The answer is 6.

[Question]Micah can type 20 words per minute and Isaiah can type 40 words per minute. How many more words can Isaiah type than Micah in an hour?
[Answer]There are 60 minutes in an hour. Micah can type 20 x 60 = 1200 words in an hour. Isaiah can type 40 x 60 = 2400 words in an hour. Isaiah can type 2400 - 1200 = 1200 words more than Micah in an hour. The answer is 1200.

Yes, that‚Äôs a really common and frustrating problem! I can tell you a few things to keep in mind when your keys are missing.  First, don‚Äôt panic.  House keys are usually just lost inside a house, and they‚Äôre usually easy to find if you look carefully.  Second, make sure you know where you last had them.  If you‚Äôre sure you did have them before you left the house, check the places you would normally keep your keys and other likely locations like pockets, purses, or bags.  Third, check with neighbors to see if anyone have seen the keys.  Often, the keys will simply have been left for a neighbor or given to them by mistake.  Finally, you should change the locks on your doors if you are really concerned about security.  The locks will need to be changed at an authorized vendor, so you might want to consider this a last resort.  I hope these tips are helpful!

here's a document:
IntroductionWord embeddings, or vector representations of words, are an important component of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and necessary for many downstream tasks. However, word embeddings, including embeddings commonly deployed for public use, have been shown to exhibit unwanted societal stereotypes and biases, raising concerns about disparate impact on axes of gender, race, ethnicity, and religion BIBREF0, BIBREF1. The impact of this bias has manifested in a range of downstream tasks, ranging from autocomplete suggestions BIBREF2 to advertisement delivery BIBREF3, increasing the likelihood of amplifying harmful biases through the use of these models.
The most well-established method thus far for mitigating bias relies on projecting target words onto a bias subspace (such as a gender subspace) and subtracting out the difference between the resulting distances BIBREF0. On the other hand, the most popular metric for measuring bias is the WEAT statistic BIBREF1, which compares the cosine similarities between groups of words. However, WEAT has been recently shown to overestimate bias as a result of implicitly relying on similar frequencies for the target words BIBREF4, and BIBREF5 demonstrated that evidence of bias can still be recovered after geometric bias mitigation by examining the neighborhood of a target word among socially-biased words.
In response to this, we propose an alternative framework for bias mitigation in word embeddings that approaches this problem from a probabilistic perspective. The motivation for this approach is two-fold. First, most popular word embedding algorithms are probabilistic at their core ‚Äì i.e., they are trained (explicitly or implicitly BIBREF6)","45    Below is an instruction that describes a task....

Answer the following question.
James pays $1000 for advertising. It brought 100 customers to his site and 80% of those bought something at the store that cost $25. How much profit does he gain from the ad?
Step-by-step reasoning process: 100 * .8 = 80 customers bought something. That means they were worth 80 * 25 = $2000. So he gained 2000 - 1000 = $1000 from the ad.
The answer is 1000.

Answer the following question.
It costs Molly $5 per package to send Christmas gifts to her relatives by mail. She has two parents and three brothers, and each of her brothers is married with 2 children each. If she sends one package to each relative by mail, how much does it cost her to send all of the gifts by mail to her relatives, in dollars?
Step-by-step reasoning process: Molly has two parents and three brothers, which totals 2 + 3 = 5 parents and siblings. Since each brother is married with 2 children, then each brother has a family containing 1 + 2 = 3 people. Thus, the families of the three brothers contain an additional 3 * 3 = 9 relatives. In total, Molly has 5 + 9 = 14 relatives. At $5 per package, Molly will spend 14 * $5 = $70 to mail the packages.
The answer is 70.

Childhood friends Dan Walker (Kevin Zegers) and Joe Lynch (Shawn Ashmore), along with Dan's girlfriend Parker O'Neill (Emma Bell), spend a Sunday afternoon at a New England ski resort. Not wanting to pay full price for three ski lift tickets, Dan convinces Parker to bribe the ski lift attendant, Jason (Ed Ackerman), to let them all on the ski lift. On the way up, the ski lift shuts down, but starts back up again shortly. After spending all afternoon watching Parker fall over herself because she cannot snowboard, the guys are eager to take one last run down the mountain before they go home. However, it is now evening, and the ski resort decides to close early because a storm is moving in.The friends remind Jason of the bribe and convince him to let them on the ski lift one last time. At this point, the resort is almost deserted. Before the group gets all the way to the top, Jason is called into the boss's office and is replaced by a co-worker, Rifkin (Adam Johnson). As Jason leaves, he tells Rifkin that there are only three skiers left and then the ski lift can be shut down. Another set of three skiers comes down the mountain. When Rifkin sees them he shuts down the ski lift, stranding them in their ski lift chair far above the ground.The friends are first annoyed; they assume that there's another technical difficulty with the ski lift. A few minutes later, however, the lights go out, scaring the three skiers. Night has come and a snow storm moves in. After a while, a snowcat comes along and it seems as if the driver, Cody (Kane Hodder), is about to see them. However","67    Below is an instruction that describes a task....

[Question]Nick's cell phone was initially empty but was then charged for 45 minutes and has reached a 25% charge. How much longer must the cell phone be charged to reach 100% charge?
[Answer]The ratio between the time charged and the time to be charged is 100 / 25 = 4. To reach 100%, the cell must be charged for 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes. Subtracting the 45 minutes that Jimmy already used to charge the cell phone, there are still 180 - 45 = 135 minutes of charging time left. The answer is 135.
Q: Clinton buys a burger meal for lunch for $6.00 and up sizes his fries and drinks for $1.00 more.  If Clinton buys this same meal every day for 5 days, how much does he spend on lunch?

Please answer the question written at the end of this research paper.

Paper:IntroductionTask-oriented chatbots are a type of dialogue generation system which tries to help the users accomplish specific tasks, such as booking a restaurant table or buying movie tickets, in a continuous and uninterrupted conversational interface and usually in as few steps as possible. The development of such systems falls into the Conversational AI domain which is the science of developing agents which are able to communicate with humans in a natural way BIBREF0. Digital assistants such as Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Alibaba's AliMe are examples of successful chatbots developed by giant companies to engage with their customers.
There are mainly two different ways to create a task-oriented chatbot which are either using set of hand-crafted and carefully-designed rules or use corpus-based method in which the chatbot can be trained with a relatively large corpus of conversational data. Given the abundance of dialogue data, the latter method seems to be a better and a more general approach for developing task-oriented chatbots. The corpus-based method also falls into two main chatbot design architectures which are pipelined and end-to-end architectures BIBREF1. End-to-end chatbots are usually neural networks based BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5 and thus can be adapted to new domains by training on relevant dialogue datasets for that specific domain. Furthermore, all sequence modelling methods can also be used in training end-to-end task-oriented chatbots. A sequence modelling method receives a sequence as input and predicts another sequence as output. For example in the case of machine translation the input could be a","72    Below is an instruction that describes a task....

Cradle cap is a skin condition that commonly affects infants, causing a thick, crusty buildup of skin oil on the scalp.  To prevent cradle cap, it‚Äôs important to regularly wash and moisturize the infant‚Äôs scalp, as well as avoid using harsh hair products or oils on the infant‚Äôs hair.  It‚Äôs also important to make sure the infant‚Äôs sleeping environment is properly ventilated, to minimize contact with moisture and humidity.  Finally, it‚Äôs important to avoid exposing the infant to excessive amounts of sunlight, as this can worsen cradle cap.

Jensen instigates a firefight, causing casualties for the pirates. Yang and Jensen fight over moral disagreements about hanging a pirate. Ross intervenes and fights with Jensen. As a result of his psychological problems, Ross reluctantly dismisses Jensen from the Expendables team.Ross and a rival mercenary Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger), meet Mr. Church (Bruce Willis). He offers them a contract to overthrow a brutal dictator, General Garza (David Zayas), on Vilena, a fictional island in the Gulf of Mexico. Busy with other things, Trench tells Church to give the contract to Ross. Christmas visits his girlfriend, Lacy (Charisma Carpenter), whom he discovers has left him for another man named Paul.

We start by completing the square: \begin{align*}
-x^2 -6x +12 &= -(x^2 + 6x) + 12\\ &= -(x^2 + 6x + (6/2)^2 - (6/2)^2) + 12\\ &= -((x+3)^2 -3^2) + 12 \\&= -(x+3)^2 +3^2 + 12 \\&= -(x+3)^2 + 21.\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is at least 0, we have $(x+3)^2\ge 0$, so $-(x+3)^2 \le 0$.  Therefore, $-(x+3)^2 + 21$ is at most 21.  Since $(x+3)^2 =0$ when $x=-3$, this maximum of $21$ is achieved when $x= \boxed{-3}$.

Consider the three-digit arrangement, $\overline{aba}$. There are $10$ choices for $a$ and $10$ choices for $b$ (since it is possible for $a=b$), and so the probability of picking the palindrome is $\frac{10 \times 10}{10^3} = \frac 1{10}$. Similarly, there is a $\frac 1{26}$ probability of picking the three-letter palindrome.
By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the total probability is

Twenty-one year-old Chris McCormick (Margaux Hemingway) is a top model for a company selling lipstick. McCormick has responsibility for her 14 year-old sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway) as their parents were killed in a car crash. They share an apartment and Kathy attends a private, Catholic school.Kathy invites her handsome, young music teacher, Gordon Stuart (Chris Sarandon) to come to one of Chris's photo shoots along the ocean because she wants her older sister to hear his somewhat avant garde musical compositions. The shoot runs long, so Chris does not have a chance to hear it, but arrangements are made for him to stop by her apartment the next day to play it for her.The next day, Stuart arrives at the apartment, but Chris has forgotten the appointment and this causes her to greet him fresh out of the shower dressed in nothing but a robe. Stuart obviously hopes that if she likes his music she might be able to use some of her musical connections to help him. While he is playing a selection from his tape recorder (the composition uses a lot of environmental sounds with electronic synthesizers) Chris is interrupted with a phone call from her boyfriend Steve Edison (Perry King) and retreats to her bedroom.The interruption and Chris's apparent apathy toward his music enrages Stuart and he enters her bedroom smashing things and hitting her. He then throws her naked across her four poster bed and secures her spread-eagle on her stomach with silk scarves to the posts and sodomizes her.Toward the end of the rape Chris has stopped struggling so when little sister Kathy arrives home from school she enters the apartment and hears nothing","34    Below is an instruction that describes a task....

Let $d$ be the distance from Bill to the center of the Earth and $f$ be the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on him. Since $f$ is inversely proportional to $d^2$, $f\cdot d^2=k$ for some constant $k$. Since the force when Bill is on the surface of Earth is 600 Newtons, $k=600\cdot4000^2=9,\!600,\!000,000$. Therefore, if we let $x$ be the force that the Earth acts on  Bill with when he is on the Moon, $x\cdot240,\!000^2=960,\!000,\!000$ so $x=\boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}$.

Alternatively, the distance between Bill and the center of the Earth has been increased by a factor of 60, so the force has to be decreased by a factor of $60^2=3600$. Since $\frac{600}{3600}=\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$, we get the same answer.

That sounds like a great idea! Drumming is a wonderful artistic and expressive activity, and also a great form of exercise and entertainment. There are many different types of drums with a wide range of sounds and uses, so it can be a very versatile and rewarding hobby. I'd recommend getting some basic instruction from a local teacher or drumming community, and also exploring a range of different types of music which utilize drums.  In terms of equipment, you will need to purchase a drum kit, which includes a variety of drums and percussion instruments. These can be acquired used from various sources, though new kits are also widely available.  In terms of further development, there are many avenues of musical exploration and performance which can be pursued, and also a wide range of specialized equipment and accessories available for drummers.

I am reluctant to dignify his hatchet job with a lengthy reply, but some of his claims are so defamatory that they should be addressed, if only for the record.          1) Krugman claims that my opening sentence--""In a way, Bill Gates's current troubles with the Justice Department grew out of an economics seminar that took place thirteen years ago, at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government""--is ""pure fiction."" Perhaps so, but in that case somebody should tell this to Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division. When I interviewed Klein for my piece about the Microsoft case, he singled out Brian Arthur as the economist who has most influenced his thinking about the way in which high-technology markets operate. It was Klein's words, not those of Arthur, that prompted me to use Arthur in the lead of the story.          2) Krugman wrote: ""Cassid","16    Below is an instruction that describes a task....

Question: Gondor is a technician, he earns $10 from repairing a phone and $20 from repairing a laptop. If he was able to repair 3 phones last Monday, 5 phones last Tuesday, 2 laptops on Wednesday, and 4 laptops last Thursday, how much does he earn in total?
Answer: Gondor was able to repair a total of 3 + 5 = 8 phones from Monday to Tuesday. And the total amount he earned is $10x8 = $80. He was able to repair a total of 2 + 4 = 6 laptops from Wednesday to Thursday. So, the total amount he earned is $20x6 = $120. Therefore, the total amount he earned is $120 + $80 = $200. The answer is 200.

Question: Gordon owns 3 restaurants, his first restaurant serves 20 meals, his second restaurant serves 40 meals, and his third restaurant serves 50 meals per day. How many meals do his 3 restaurants serve per week?
Answer: Gordon serves 20 x 7 = 140 meals in his first restaurant per week. He serves 40 x 7 = 280 meals in his second restaurant per week. At the third restaurant, he serves 50 x 7 = 350 meals per week. Therefore, he serves 140 + 280 + 350 = 770 meals in total per week. The answer is 770.

Question: During the soccer match, The Kickers scored 2 goals in the first period and twice that amount in the second period. The other team, The Spiders, scored half the amount that The Kickers scored in the first period and twice the amount that The Kickers scored in their second period. What is the total amount of goals both teams scored?
Answer: The Kickers scored twice as many as 2 goals in the second period, so 2 * 2 = 4 goals. The Spiders scored half as many as The Kickers' 2 goals from the 1st period so .5 * 2 = 1 goal in the first period. The Spiders scored twice as many as The Kickers' 4 goals from the second period, so 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second period. Together, they scored 2 + 4 + 1 + 8 = 15 goals total. The answer is 15.

Well there‚Äôs a lot of cultural factors, but I think an important difference is the prevalence of obesity in the West versus Asia.  In 2016, according to the CDC, about 35% of Americans are obese, while the number in Japan is only 4.8%.

Article: IntroductionProcessing of free-text clinical records play an important role in computer-supported medicine BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 . A detailed description of symptoms, examination and an interview is often stored in an unstructured way as free-text, hard to process but rich in important information. Some attempts of processing medical notes exist for English, while for other languages the problem is still challenging BIBREF2 .
A clustering task is easier for structured data such as age, sex, place, history of diseases, ICD-10 code etc. (an example of patients clustering based only on their history of diseases is BIBREF3 ), but it is far from being solved for unstructured free-texts.
The clustering of visits has many applications. If we are able to group visits into clusters based on interview with a patient and medical examination then (1) we can follow recommendations that were applied to patients with similar visits in the past to create a list of possible diagnoses, (2) reveal that the current diagnosis is unusual, (3) identify subsets of visits with the same diagnosis but different symptoms.
A desired goal in the clustering is to divide patients into groups with similar properties. In the case of clustering hospitalized patients one of the most well-known examples are Diagnosis Related Groups BIBREF4 which aim to divide patients into groups with similar costs of treatment. Grouping visits of patients in health centers is a different issue. Here most of the information is unstructured and included in the visit's description written by a doctor: the description of the interview with the patient and the description of a medical exam","17    Below is an instruction that describes a task....

Sure! Well, there are several Pantheons, but most people are probably referring to the Pantheon in Rome, Italy.  The Pantheon‚Äôs architecture dates to around 100 AD, although a church has existed on the site since the late 6th century.  The Pantheon was once a temple of ancient Rome, dedicated to the city‚Äôs pagan gods.  Then the site was renovated and turned into a Catholic Church, and later into a Catholic church.  In the 16th century, the Pantheon was damaged by a massive earthquake, and then it was restored into a church again, and later renovated again into a church and a Catholic basilica.  Finally, it was opened up as a museum in the 20th century.  I can go into more detail if you‚Äôd like!

Article: IntroductionRecent studies in information extraction domain (but also in other natural language processing fields) show that deep learning models produce state-of-the-art results BIBREF0 . Deep architectures employ multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of the input data. In the last few years, neural networks based on dense vector representations provided the best results in various NLP tasks, including named entities recognition BIBREF1 , semantic role labelling BIBREF2 , question answering BIBREF3 and multitask learning BIBREF4 . The core element of most deep learning solutions is the dense distributed semantic representation of words, often called word embeddings. Distributional vectors follow the distributional hypothesis that words with a similar meaning tend to appear in similar contexts. Word embeddings capture the similarity between words and are often used as the first layer in deep learning models. Two of the most common and very efficient methods to produce word embeddings are Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram (SG), which produce distributed representations of words in a vector space, grouping them by similarity BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 . With the progress of machine learning techniques, it is possible to train such models on much larger data sets, and these often outperform the simple ones. It is possible to use a set of text documents containing even billions of words as training data. Both architectures (CBOW and SG) describe how the neural network learns the vector word representations for each word. In CBOW architecture the task is predicting the word given its context and in SG the task in predicting the context given the word.

THE GREAT NEBRASKA SEABy ALLAN DANZIG Illustrated by WOOD [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Magazine August 1963.

Everyone‚Äîall the geologists, at any rate‚Äîhad known about the Kiowa Fault for years. That was before there was anything very interesting to know about it. The first survey of Colorado traced its course north and south in the narrow valley of Kiowa Creek about twenty miles east of Denver; it extended south to the Arkansas River. And that was about all even the professionals were interested in knowing. There was never so much as a landslide to bring the Fault to the attention of the general public.
 It was still a matter of academic interest when in the late '40s geologists speculated on the relationship between the Kiowa Fault and the Conchas Fault farther south, in New Mexico, and which followed the Pecos as far south as Texas.
 Nor was there much in the papers a few years later when it was suggested that the Niobrara Fault (just inside and roughly parallel to the eastern border of Wyoming) was a northerly extension of the Kiowa.
 By the mid sixties it was definitely established that the three Faults were in fact a single line of fissure in the essential rock, stretching almost from the Canadian border well south of the New Mexico-Texas line.
 It is not really surprising that it took so long to figure out the connection. The population of the states affected was in places as low as","4    Below is an instruction that describes a task....

Q: Keaton climbed a 30 feet ladder twenty times while working at the construction site. Reece, also working at the same site, climbed a ladder 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder 15 times. What's the total length of the ladders that both workers climbed in inches?
A: If Keaton climbed his ladder twenty times, he covered a length of 30 * 20 = 600 feet. Reece's ladder, 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder, was 30 - 4 = 26 feet long. If Reece climbed the ladder 15 times, he covered a length of 15 * 26 = 390 feet. Keaton and Reece's total length covered while climbing the ladders is 390 + 600 = 990 feet. Since one foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length they climbed the ladders in inches is 12 * 990 = 11880 inches. The answer is 11880.
Question: The flowers cost $9, the clay pot costs $20 more than the flower, and the bag of soil costs $2 less than the flower. How much does it cost to plant the flowers?
Answer: The clay pot costs $20 + $9 = $29. The bag of soil costs $9 - $2 = $7. The cost to plant the flowers is $9 + $29 + $7 = $45. The answer is 45.

Given these paragraphs about Large language models, what is hallucination?
A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.

Properties
Though the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.

Though trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to ""memorize"" a great quantity of facts during training.

Hallucinations
Main article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)
In artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a ""hallucination"" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.

\story:
For several generations the Parks family lived on a quiet hillside where Katelyn's grandfather and her father (Mike Daly) were keepers to the town's lighthouse. At the age of ten, Katelyn watched her mom enter the basement in their lighthouse home where minutes later she was brutally beaten and found dying on the floor. Her father, Christopher (Mike Daly), was arrested and convicted for the killing, and Katelyn placed in foster care out of town. The murder drove Christopher into madness and he was sentenced to a mental institution, where he later died. Katelyn never had a chance to speak to her father since that horrible night.
Twenty years later, Katelyn (Lindy Booth) receives a mysterious letter which brings her back to the lighthouse home she swore she would never return to again. Maine coastal town Harrison Bay is broke, so deputy mayor Drew Cabot (James Thomas) arranges a deal with a contractor to develop the abandoned lighthouse for tourism. Father Hendry (Lawrence Dane) fails to convince the town council to veto the project. The town wants to open the lighthouse back up but someone from Katelyn's foggy past warns her to stop them! What they don't tell her is ""why"". Katelyn is forced to confront the evil that lurks within the lighthouse when some of the developers slowly begin to disappear. What she discovers is a family secret long buried by her grandfather. She must now unearth the truth and find a way to stop the nightmare which surrounds the lighthouse.

[Question]Carla works at a food bank and she currently has stocked up 2000 cans of food. One day, 500 people showed up and took 1 can of food each. Carla had to then restock 1500 more cans to keep up with demand. The next day, 1000 people showed up and took 2 cans of food each. Carla restocked again with 3000 cans of food this time. How many cans of food did Carla give away?
[Answer]One day, 2000 - 500 = 1500 cans of food were left. It was then restocked to 1500 + 1500 = 3000 cans. 1000 * 2 = 2000 cans were taken the next day. 3000 - 2000 = 1000 cans were left. It was restocked once more to 1000 + 3000 = 4000 cans of food. Carla gave away 500 + 2000 = 2500 cans of food. The answer is 2500.

\summary:Amistad is the name of a slave ship traveling from Cuba to the United States in 1839. It is carrying African people as its cargo. As the ship is crossing from Cuba to the United States, Cinqu√É¬©, a leader of the Africans, leads a mutiny and takes over the ship. The mutineers spare the lives of two Spanish navigators to help them sail the ship back to Africa. Instead, the navigators play out the Africans and sail north to the east coast of the United States, where the ship is stopped by the American Navy, and the 53 living Africans imprisoned as runaway slaves.
In an unfamiliar country and not speaking a single word of English, the Africans find themselves in a legal battle. District Attorney William S. Holabird brings charges of piracy and murder. The Secretary of State John Forsyth, on behalf of President Martin Van Buren (who is campaigning for re-election), represents the claim of Queen Isabella II of Spain that the Africans are slaves and are property of Spain based on a treaty. Two Naval officers claim them as salvage while the two Spanish navigators produce proof of purchase. A lawyer named Roger Sherman Baldwin, hired by the abolitionist Tappan and his black associate Joadson (a fictional character[1]) decides to defend the Africans.
Baldwin argues that the Africans had been captured in Africa to be sold in the Americas illegally. Baldwin proves through documents found hidden on Amistad that the African people were initially cargo belonging to a Portuguese slave ship, The Tecora. Therefore, the Africans were free citizens of another country and not slaves at all. In light of this evidence","65    Below is an instruction that describes a task....

Ishbo (Rifkin) is the younger son of Mookoo (Carradine), the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik (MacArthur). He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart (Larter). Much to his dismay, immediately after he finally expresses his love to her she is ""clubbed"" by Thudnik (and all that follows in the tradition of caveman stereotypes), and eventually married to him. Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life.
After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt. He falls into a large pile of mammoth dung, then is eaten by the mammoth, and eventually excreted (or extracted √¢¬Ä¬ì the scene itself appears as a series of animated cave drawings) from the mammoth when it is finally killed by the rest of the tribesmen.

\story: Republican Shakeout          This weekend's straw poll in Ames, Iowa, kicked off the 2000 presidential race and sorted out the Republican field. Everyone agrees that George W. Bush is the front-runner, that Steve Forbes is in second place, and that Dan Quayle, who finished back in the pack with Lamar Alexander, will soon join Alexander on the sidelines. But Ames failed to resolve the fate of the candidates who came in third and fourth--Elizabeth Dole and Gary Bauer--and the one who skipped Ames, John McCain. For these three, the post-game spin contest is crucial. Here's a playback of their takes on the straw poll results and a look ahead at their playbook of messages for the remainder of the race.

Dole needed to get within striking distance of Bush and to seal off the rest of the pack behind her. On Meet the Press , Face the Nation , and Late Edition , she boasted that she had cracked ""the top three."" Pundits bought the three-winners line, treating Ames as a horse race (""win, place, and show"") and noting that ""no one's ever won the Republican nomination without finishing in the top three"" at Ames. Newspapers, cramped for space, confined their headlines to Bush, Forbes, and Dole. Though Dole's 14 percent was closer to Bauer's 9 than to Forbes' 21, she earned a ""solid third"" and a place among the leaders by crossing the ""double-digit","65    Below is an instruction that describes a task....

Christian Martin, a modest accountant in a large firm owned by Bertrand Barnier, surprises his boss by asking him for a 100% increase in his wages. Martin is on the point of proposing to a girl and doesn't want to ask for her hand in marriage while making a lowly accountant's salary.
After Barnier refuses to give him the raise, Martin tells him that he's stolen more than sixty million francs from him by falsifying the firm's accounting records. When Barnier threatens to report this to the police, Martin points out that as a consequence of the fraud Barnier has now submitted false income statements to the tax office, a serious crime. Barnier has no choice but to give in to blackmail and he agrees to give Martin the raise and name him vice-president of the firm.
Martin then reveals that the young woman whom he intends to marry is Barnier's daughter. In order to recover his sixty million francs, Barnier asks Martin to give back the stolen monies so that he can give them to his daughter as a wedding present.
Barnier learns that Martin converted the sum into jewelry and the jewels are in a bank. He tells Martin to get the jewelry, but Martin refuses without a signed document from Barnier stating that he will give the jewelry to his daughter as a wedding present. Barnier agrees and Martin leaves for the bank.
While Martin is gone, Barnier talks to his daughter Colette. Without mentioning Martin, he tells her that he's opposed to her marriage which causes her to break down and cry. On the advice of her maid Bernadette, Colette lies to","93    Below is an instruction that describes a task....
